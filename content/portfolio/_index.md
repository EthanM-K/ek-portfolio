This portfolio is a showcase of a variety of skills, focused specifically on [[Automated Machine Design]] but also [[Electrical Design]], [[Programming]], and [[Operations Improvement]]. This is a collection of projects from my most recent position as Mechanical Engineer III at Trek Bicycle Company.

Projects can be viewed dynamically grouped by area of interest by using the below links:
* Mechanical Design
* Mechanical Drawings
* Engineering Calculations
* Electrical Design
* Programming
* Writing Samples

Or items can be grouped by skill 
* 3D CAD
* Python
* Jira
* anything and everything, dynamically generated

Otherwise projects may be viewed chronologically using the toolbar at the left. 

The intention is that some recruiter could quickly look at all of the examples of some skill on one page

I'm thinking we could accomplish this by creating tags for every paragraph of content and then filtering all of the content by those tags on different pages, which is more like something obsidian can do. 

A note on CAD images. There is some inconsistency throughout the images- some are rendered and some are in Onshape.
